I would prefer waterfall model design to create app/website. I would have first developed requirement analysis and then create design for the system design. I would have implement it as per it's required and surely after implementation we should test it whether it is right or not. Once the functional and non-functional testing is done; the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market. And at the last stage there are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues, pathches are realased. Also to enhance the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.
